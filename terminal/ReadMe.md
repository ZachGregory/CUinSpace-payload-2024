terminal is a ground station UI designed to work with the payload by receiving live data from the payload through its LoRa module. terminal displays data in an easy to understand (and cool) looking way using dynamic css styling. 
Run on node.js, terminal is a portable and easy to deploy software. To run you must plug in the MKR 1310 module into your computer and terminal does the rest.

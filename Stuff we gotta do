Stuff we need people to do:

Electronicss
Connect all the sensors to thge arduinp, figure out how to use an i2c bus so that multiple sensors can use the same i2c port on the arduinpo( also a bit of programming).
Connect up batteries somehow. (likely buck converter leading to servos and arduino independantly.
Create a new wiring schematic that uses an arduino nano instead of the uno. 
Create in altium as schematic to connerct all the sensors together with the new wiring and power management. 
shielding for the magnetometor from the motors 

Programming
make all the sensors work at the sdame time in one program
Make the sensors move the servos based on a gps target
Create microgravity subroutines (wayyy later)

Mechanical:
Figure out a better way to move the strings (ptfe blocks?)
Look inot better configurations for the eelectronics and motors

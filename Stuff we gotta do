Stuff we need people to do:

Electronicss
Connect all the sensors to the arduino, figure out how to use an i2c bus so that multiple sensors can use the same i2c port on the arduino ( also a bit of programming).
Connect up batteries somehow. (likely buck converter leading to servos and arduino independantly.)
Create a new wiring schematic that uses an arduino MKR instead of the uno. 
Create in altium as schematic to connect all the sensors together with the new wiring and power management. 
shielding for the magnetometor from the motors 

Programming
Make the sensors move the servos based on a gps target
Wind correction
Create microgravity subroutines

Mechanical:
Parachute deployment
Upper Cube final design.
Figure out a better way to direct the strings (ptfe blocks?)
Vibration damping
Camera locations

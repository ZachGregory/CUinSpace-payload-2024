# CUinSpace-payload-2024
This is a repository for all code related to the 2023-2024 CUinSpace Payload. 

Contents will include:

-Payload Parachute Test Platform (PPTP)
  An arduino based platform to test the sensors, motors, and algorithms required for the payload. This is the upper part of the payload designed to be a bolt on recovery system for the bottom experiment part of the payload. The PPTP should be about a 1U cubesat or smaller. This test platform will be 3D printed and likely use an Arduino Uno and a Proto-shield. While this won't meet competition standards it is important to ensure the circuits, sensors, and code work properly before sending boards to PCB manufacturers. To be completed before the end of August (hopefully fedex picks up the pace and ships the sensors soon). Should take 1 week to complete once components arrive (hopefully).

-Payload Parachute Recovery System (PPRS) (I like acronyms sue me)
  This will be the continuation of the PPTP moving into the fall semester. We will move to make everything smaller, swap from Arduino Uno to the Arduino Nano (or pi zero if required), create real PCBs, swap 3D printed construction to aluminum or stainless. The size should be about 0.5U or smaller (if possible). This will take place through the fall semester and into the start of the winter semester. Hopefully having everything assembled and tested by around February/March.

-Payload Biological Experiment (PBE?)
  This will be designed and constructed simultaneously with the PPRS. It is the lower portion of the payload and contains the experiment. The current idea for the experiment is a RPi camera observing a cell culture through a microscope (I think) as the cells undergo the extreme G-forces of the rocket. The question remains of why we have the PPRS and are ejecting out of the rocket which we will need to explain to judges. 




For next years payload what if we tried using neurons to control the direction of the parachute
